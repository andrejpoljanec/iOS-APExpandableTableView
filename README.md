# iOS-APExpandableTableView

To convert a normal table into an expandable table, there are multiple solutions. The idea in this implementation is to have two types of cells, group cells and child cells. Group cells are normal cells just like in any other table. Child cells are each actually a complete table within which we define the real child cells. So child cells are actually another UITableView inside a UITableViewCell. The expandable table view then functions in a way that when a group cell is clicked, a table is inserted as a child cell. When a group cell is clicked again, the child table is removed to make the group collapse. The idea has its pros and cons, but I like it because it groups up the child cells together and keeps them separate from group cells. Reordering also makes much more sense in this way.
